        "1. This paper is about how tidy data can streamline the data cleaning process. It is mentioned that data cleaning, while used by every data scientist, does not have an efficient process. It describes a case study that will show how to \"tidy\" data properly\n",
        "\n",
        "2. By standardizing data cleaning into the \"tiny data\" standard, there will be consistency and efficiency across the board of data cleaning. If all data is cleaned to a standard, then it can be more easily intrepreted since the objective is clear.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The first sentence means that tidy data is all organized the same and have similar properties. Messy data, on the other hand, is disorganized, not structured, and can nuances that are based on the people who created the data set. The second sentence nods to the fact that when looking at a data set, it is relitively easy based on the layout and titles to find which are observations (rows) and which are variables (columns). Even though orginazation is clear, it can be hard to give meaning to the observations and variables. This confusion cna lead to poor data cleaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. A dataset is a collection of values which can be strings or numerical. Each value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable is a collection of values that all measure the same attribute like height or temperature. An observation contians all values measured in the same unit like a day or person.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Tidy data is defined when each variable is a column, each observation is row, and each type of observational unit is a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. The 5 most common problems with messy data sets are column headers are values and not variable names, multiple variables are stored in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, and single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. The data in table 4 are messy because the columns are values of \"hidden\" variables of income. To fix this, there should be a new variable called \"income.\" Melting a dataset is the process of converting column-value variables into rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Table 11 has the value of days along the top. In tbale 12, those values are melted into the single variable of date. The table is still messy because the element variable has variable names tmax and tmin. Table 12b is tidy and molten becuase all the entries are attributes and not variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. It is a problem about local maxima when changing data structures and tools. If tidy data only works by using certain tools, then it is not functional. Wickman hopes that tidy data will transform and streamline the data cleaning world and create more tools and ideas."

        "1. The 2023 ACS census gathered data on race by frist giving a question on Hispanic origin, in which you can select the boxes that apply, as well as a drop down option to add more specific information. They also ask a seperate question in which you select the box that applies to you most (White, Africian American, American indian, etc...) and then are prompted to give more information about your origins.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. There are many reasons to collect this data. Census data can allow for economic, social, or even political questions to form or lead to answers. It can be important to know where different demographic groups are and how people are spread. From the data, it can be determined what parts of the country are diverse, and how to foster this diversity. The quality of the data is vital. If economic, social, or poticial conclusions are drawn from data that is not high quality, there can be nagative implications. It is important that the data is high quality to alievate bias as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. I think that the census did a good job having wide spread categories for questions, and specific questions within those categories. The posed questions, if answered accurately, can give very detailed data about the population. A wekaness of the census data collection could be the skewedness in questions aimed at those in the middle class or higher. I also think that there was a clear lack of inclusivenes in the sex/sexuality category. It does not give a drop down option or a fill i nthe blank for people to be specific and accurate in their answers.\n",
        "For the future, there should be an emphasis of questions having to do with personal identity being more openended and inclusive. The good practices of having a robust number of questions in a wide range of categories should be adopted to other studies.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The census gather info on sex by simply asking whether the person is male or female, and asks them to check one box only with no drop down choice. There is no additional question about gender. This is not inclusive of all people, and will result in inaccurate/non-detailed data. There should be more options, especially open-ended questions, to allow for everyone's identity to be included.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. By not providing a place to input a unique drop down answer, or having no option for \"prefer not to answer,\" the census data is not accurate. It is not a fair practice to require people to answer personal questions, or force them to confor mtheir identiy into a check box. A concern with missing values would be that a pre made model would try to \"match\" the individual with an identify based on their other answers. This is not a valid or accurate process, and includes bias into results.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. I would have extreme concerns about bias. The algorithim has to be built based off of past data, and if that data is biased, then so will the algorithim. Another concern would be that the people who left answers blank, especially about questions regarding identity, do so with a reason. By filling in that value with a predicted identity, their choice of leaving their identity out is negated."
